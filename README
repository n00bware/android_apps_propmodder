THIS PROGRAM IS IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

+Commit history line will serve as a ChangLog for now

We love Github's issue tracker(Please submit bugs here) and encourage people to fork and submit pull requests

+Make note of the git tags the main tree isn't always buildable as the app is still in development.  If you want to compile a working version of the app be sure to use the version tags

+This app is free(RootzWiki)/donation(Android Market) or you can compile it yourself

To Compile PropModder using Eclipse:

Create a new Android project.
Choose to create one using existing source. Use this source of course.
Copy development/ide/eclipse/.classpath to the root of your project directory.
Refresh the project in Eclipse.

This assumes you have the CyanogenMod source loaded into Eclipse.
If you don't you will have to adjust the build path.
